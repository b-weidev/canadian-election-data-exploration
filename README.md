The dataset contains one csv file for each electoral district or ‘riding’ for each Canadian federal
election between 1997 and 2019. These CSVs contain a row for every candidate’s results at a
polling station in the riding. We have also included CSVs that show contributions to political
entities from 1993 to 1999, 2000 to 2004, and 2004 to present.
