Exploring data from recent Canadian elections using SQL queries.

## Domain
Canadian elections and the impact of political donations on election results.

## Dataset

The dataset contains one csv file for each electoral district or ‘riding’ for each Canadian federal
election between 1997 and 2019. These CSVs contain a row for every candidate’s results at a
polling station in the riding. We have also included CSVs that show contributions to political
entities from 1993 to 1999, 2000 to 2004, and 2004 to present.

## Exploratory Questions
1. Can any factors (donations/overall winner/provincial winner) predict whether an incumbent candidate is likely to lose their seat?
2. How do donations amounts relate to election outcomes on local and overall levels?
3. Do candidates who ran for the leadership of their party have a higher chance of winning their local election?
